# Ghost Fishing Fixes
Fixes player clients not displaying fishing rods properly when cast by "ghost/fake players" (i.e. players that the server does not tell the clients about).
Normally these fishing rods are not rendered at all but this makes it possible.

This mod is particularly useful with [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) in particular because its Deployer block uses a server-side fake player to perform actions like fishing.
